# Clone Websites Code

#### Welcome everyone! ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp; This is a list of websites, components that i've built to practice HTML, CSS & JS. I will keep updating the list

&nbsp;

#### Some the inspiration came from [UI Design Daily](https://uidesigndaily.com/) and [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

&nbsp;

#### I've created this table to not only keep track of it but also for anyone that is interested of the solutions.
